# YouTube API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://console.developers.google.com/
# Enable YouTube Data API v3 for your project
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here

# Note: This is a public environment variable (NEXT_PUBLIC_) 
# which means it will be exposed to the browser.
# YouTube API keys are safe to expose client-side when properly configured
# with domain restrictions in the Google Cloud Console.

# Production Usage:
# 1. Create a project in Google Cloud Console
# 2. Enable YouTube Data API v3
# 3. Create an API key
# 4. Restrict the key to your domain(s) for security
# 5. Set daily quota limits as needed (free tier: 10,000 units/day)

# Free quota is typically sufficient for small to medium applications:
# - Search request: ~100 quota units
# - ~100 search requests per day on free tier
# - Each activity search uses 1 request = sustainable for most use cases
